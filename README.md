Honoring the tradition
I'm new here on GitHub, I'm also a bit of a newbie in programming. I'm in my college junior year of my CS Major focusing on mobile application and software development. I've got some practice in Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and a bit in Linux. I'm still far from being a wellspring of knowledge in either language, but that's why I'm here. I'm trying to improive.
